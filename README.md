Facial Expression Recognition with PyTorch, loading a pretrained state of the art model CNN and trained in PyTorch to classify facial expressions. Data used consists of 48 x 48 pixel grayscale images of faces and there are seven targets (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral). Applied augmentation for classification task to augment images. created train and evaluator function which is helpful to write training loop. Lastly, used best trained model to classify expression given any input image.
